# Overview

Our integrations of post-quantum cryptography into wolfSSL provides:
- Post-quantum cryptography for TLS 1.3 handshake (post-quantum key exchange and post-quantum authentication)
- Support for post-quantum X.509 certificates (generate, verify, etc.)
- Benchmark of PQC algorithms via wolfcrypt's benchmark tool

# Status

## Integrated PQC Schemes

All integrated schemes can be enabled/disabled via wolfSSL's build mechanism, which is based on GNU autoconf (see below for details).
The desired security mode, on the other hand, must be configured in [wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h](wolfssl/wolfcrypt/settings.h) prior compilation.

For details on the specific algorithms, we refer the reader to corresponding algorithm specification.

## Limitations and Notes on Security
This prototypical work integrates  reference implementations of selected PQC schemes from NIST's PQC standardization project into wolfSSL. While there are currently no vulnerabilities know in those implementations, it is strongly recommended to be very cautious when deploying post-quantum cryptography as these schemes and their implementations have not seen the same amount of security analysis as currently deployed public key cryptography has. For up-to-date information on these schemes, please pay close attention to any PQC-related announcements by [NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/post-quantum-cryptography/news).

The main goal of this project is to help academia and industry with prototyping. 
Note that our modifications have not been subject to the same degree of auditing and analysis as would be required for security-related software projects.
As a consequence, **WE DO NOT RECOMMEND TO USE THIS PROJECT IN ANY REAL-WORLD DEPLOYMENTS**.

# wolfSSL Embedded SSL/TLS Library (original README) 

The [wolfSSL embedded SSL library](https://www.wolfssl.com/products/wolfssl/) 
(formerly CyaSSL) is a lightweight SSL/TLS library written in ANSI C and
targeted for embedded, RTOS, and resource-constrained environments - primarily
because of its small size, speed, and feature set.  It is commonly used in
standard operating environments as well because of its royalty-free pricing
and excellent cross platform support. wolfSSL supports industry standards up
to the current [TLS 1.3](https://www.wolfssl.com/tls13) and DTLS 1.2, is up to
20 times smaller than OpenSSL, and offers progressive ciphers such as ChaCha20,
Curve25519, NTRU, and Blake2b. User benchmarking and feedback reports
dramatically better performance when using wolfSSL over OpenSSL.

wolfSSL is powered by the wolfCrypt cryptography library. Two versions of
wolfCrypt have been FIPS 140-2 validated (Certificate #2425 and
certificate #3389). FIPS 140-3 validation is in progress. For additional
information, visit the [wolfCrypt FIPS FAQ](https://www.wolfssl.com/license/fips/)
or contact fips@wolfssl.com.

## Why Choose wolfSSL?

There are many reasons to choose wolfSSL as your embedded, desktop, mobile, or
enterprise SSL/TLS solution. Some of the top reasons include size (typical
footprint sizes range from 20-100 kB), support for the newest standards
(SSL 3.0, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.2, TLS 1.3, DTLS 1.0, and DTLS 1.2), current
and progressive cipher support (including stream ciphers), multi-platform,
royalty free, and an OpenSSL compatibility API to ease porting into existing
applications which have previously used the OpenSSL package. For a complete
feature list, see [Chapter 4](https://www.wolfssl.com/docs/wolfssl-manual/ch4/)
of the wolfSSL manual.

## Notes, Please Read

**Note 1)**
wolfSSL as of 3.6.6 no longer enables SSLv3 by default.  wolfSSL also no longer
supports static key cipher suites with PSK, RSA, or ECDH. This means if you
plan to use TLS cipher suites you must enable DH (DH is on by default), or
enable ECC (ECC is on by default), or you must enable static key cipher suites
with one or more of the following defines:

    WOLFSSL_STATIC_DH
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA
    WOLFSSL_STATIC_PSK

Though static key cipher suites are deprecated and will be removed from future
versions of TLS.  They also lower your security by removing PFS.  Since current
NTRU suites available do not use ephemeral keys, ```WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA``` needs
to be used in order to build with NTRU suites.

When compiling ssl.c, wolfSSL will now issue a compiler error if no cipher
suites are available. You can remove this error by defining
```WOLFSSL_ALLOW_NO_SUITES``` in the event that you desire that, i.e., you're
not using TLS cipher suites.

**Note 2)**
wolfSSL takes a different approach to certificate verification than OpenSSL
does. The default policy for the client is to verify the server, this means
that if you don't load CAs to verify the server you'll get a connect error,
no signer error to confirm failure (-188).

If you want to mimic OpenSSL behavior of having SSL\_connect succeed even if
verifying the server fails and reducing security you can do this by calling:

    wolfSSL_CTX_set_verify(ctx, SSL_VERIFY_NONE, 0);

before calling wolfSSL\_new();. Though it's not recommended.

**Note 3)**
The enum values SHA, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512 are no longer available when
wolfSSL is built with --enable-opensslextra (```OPENSSL_EXTRA```) or with the
macro ```NO_OLD_SHA_NAMES```. These names get mapped to the OpenSSL API for a
single call hash function. Instead the name WC_SHA, WC_SHA256, WC_SHA384 and
WC_SHA512 should be used for the enum name.

# wolfSSL Release 4.7.0 (February 16, 2021)

* Increase output buffer size that wolfSSL_RAND_bytes can handle
* Out of directory builds resolved, wolfSSL can now be built in a separate directory than the root wolfssl directory

### Vulnerabilities
* [HIGH] CVE-2021-3336: In earlier versions of wolfSSL there exists a potential man in the middle attack on TLS 1.3 clients. Malicious attackers with a privileged network position can impersonate TLS 1.3 servers and bypass authentication. Users that have applications with client side code and have TLS 1.3 turned on, should update to the latest version of wolfSSL. Users that do not have TLS 1.3 turned on, or that are server side only, are NOT affected by this report. For the code change see https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfssl/pull/3676.
* [LOW] In the case of using custom ECC curves there is the potential for a crafted compressed ECC key that has a custom prime value to cause a hang when imported. This only affects applications that are loading in ECC keys with wolfSSL builds that have compressed ECC keys and custom ECC curves enabled.
* [LOW] With TLS 1.3 authenticated-only ciphers a section of the server hello could contain 16 bytes of uninitialized data when sent to the connected peer. This affects only a specific build of wolfSSL with TLS 1.3 early data enabled and using authenticated-only ciphers with TLS 1.3.
